It's easy to create your own templates if you have basic HTML and CSS knowledge. I shall explain in short
how you can create your own:

	1. Create a single page design for your faucet.
	2. Save the design as DESIGN_NAME.template.php inside the templates directory.
	3. Add a PHP switch statement for the different possible Simple Faucet statuses. (see the default.template.php for the switch statement, more on the statuses below)
	4. Add a POST form with a text input field by name 'doge_address' and 'captcha_code' (if you have CAPTCHAs enabled in the config)
	5. Add any placeholder texts you'd like. (all placeholders are listed below)
	6. Save the file and test it out.

Remember you can always look at the default template if you need an example.


SIMPLE FAUCET STATUSES:

In order to display different things on the page you should make use of the status of your Simple Faucet
install.

You can get the status inside a template with the PHP call $this->status(), if you don't know how this 
works, take a look at the default template.

There are a few statuses:

	- SF_STATUS_OPERATIONAL : 				Everything works and the faucet is ready to send transaction. You should display the input form on this state.
	- SF_STATUS_PAYOUT_ACCEPTED : 			The faucet succesfully paid some Dogecoins to the user, display some kind of 'congratulations' screen.
	- SF_STATUS_RPC_CONNECTION_FAILED : 	The faucet could not connect to the wallet/RPC server.
	- SF_STATUS_MYSQL_CONNECTION_FAILED :	The faucet could not connect to the MySQL server/database.
	- SF_STATUS_PAYOUT_DENIED :				The user tried to receive DOGE within the specified interval.
	- SF_STATUS_INVALID_DOGE_ADDRESS : 		The DOGE address put in by the user is invalid.
	- SF_STATUS_PAYOUT_ERROR :				Something went wrong whilst trying to send DOGE to the user. (this usually means the wallet is encrypted and the wrong passphrase was given)
	- SF_STATUS_CAPTCHA_INCORRECT : 		The user failed the CAPTCHA.
	- SF_STATUS_DRY_FAUCET : 				The faucet balance is below the threshold.


SIMPLE FAUCET PLACEHOLDER TEXTS:

You can easily display various texts and statistics by adding placeholder texts. A placeholder text looks like this: {{PAYOUT_AMOUNT}}

This is a list of all placeholder texts:

	- {{minimum_payout}} : 		The minimum payout amount as set in the config.
	- {{maximum_payout}} :		The maximum payout amount as set in the config.
	- {{payout_threshold}} : 	The payout threshold as set in the config.
	- {{donation_address}} : 	The donation address as set in the config.
	- {{title}} : 				The title of the Faucet as set in the config.
	- {{balance}} : 			The current balance of the faucet.
	- {{average_payout}} : 		The average payout.
	- {{total_payout}} : 		The grand total of all the payouts.
	- {{smallest_payout}} : 	The smallest payout that was ever awarded.
	- {{largest_payout}} : 		The largest payout that was ever awarded.
	- {{number_of_payouts}} : 	The total number of payout. (count)
	- {{payout_amount}} : 		The payout amount to the current user. (only use this at the SF_STATUS_PAYOUT_ACCEPTED state)
	- {{payout_address}} : 		The payout address of the current user. (only use this at the SF_STATUS_PAYOUT_ACCEPTED state)
	- {{captcha}} : 			The CAPTCHA image. (if CAPTCHA is enabled)
	- {{captcha_url}} : 		The CAPTCHA image URL. (if CAPTCHA is enabled)
